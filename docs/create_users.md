# Creating users

Unless you the instance is configured to allow public registration there are two ways to add users.

1.) Create a invitation from the command-line with


```
gotrxx invite seed
```

This will generate a invite code wich can be used to register a new user.



2.) Create a user directnly from the command-line:


```
gotrxx user create
```

This will launch a cli dialog wich allows to enter user details.
