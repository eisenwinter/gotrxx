# Creating users

Unless the instance is configured to allow public registration there are two ways to add users.

1.) Create an invitation from the command-line with

```
gotrxx invite seed
```

This will generate an invite code which can be used to register a new user.


2.) Create a user directly from the command line:


```
gotrxx user create
```

This will launch a command line dialog witch allows entering user details.
