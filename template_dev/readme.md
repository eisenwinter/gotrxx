# Template Boilerplate

This is a 11ty boilerplate to generate the templates,
it was all fun and games with the static html templates until I had to change one thing - so yeah 
this can be used to regenerate the templates and adapt them


## How to use this 

Run `yarn` to install the dev dependencies

Run `yarn dev` to launch dev server instance

Once done run `yarn build` to build  `templates` folder, replace with  content `./templates`. Done.
